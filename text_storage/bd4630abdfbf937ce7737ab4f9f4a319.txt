When Speed and Scale Collide
Data systems are often described along two axes: speed and scale.

Choosing between free threading and async in Python
As host of this year’s first PyAmsterdam Meetup, Optiver welcomed the local Python community back to our headquarters for an evening of tech talks, networking and knowledge sharing. To open the event, Optiver Senior Software Engineer and Team Lead Samet Yaslan delivered a timely talk for developers working on performance-critical systems: “Choosing Between Free Threading and Async.”
Prompting his choice of topic was a recent change in CPython, as Samet explained:
“Beginning with version 3.13, CPython introduces an option for a build known as free threading, where the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is removed. The question is: With the GIL gone, do we still need async in Python?”
Here’s how he breaks it down, and what it means for your next Python project.
