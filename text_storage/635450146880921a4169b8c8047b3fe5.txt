This 45-minute interview will cover both technical and behavioral skills. We use video, so be sure you’re camera-ready!

These aren’t trick questions: we just want to learn more about your strategy and process. The interviewer will also ask about your technical interests, past internship experience, school projects and your reasons for exploring opportunities at Citadel.
